# Physical Adaptability

**Definition:** The system accommodates diverse physical postures, device setups and hardware configurations, including a range of assistive input technologies, and user contexts. 

**Consider:** Avoid assumptions about seated/standing use or proximity to screens. Interfaces should scale and reflow responsively, and input targets should be operable from various motor ranges.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Ensure touch targets are reachable and reconfigurable for users operating from wheelchairs or using extended input devices.

_Example 2._ Consider providing links or QR codes for users to access the system on their device.
