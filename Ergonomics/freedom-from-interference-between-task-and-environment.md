# Freedom from interference between task & environment

**Definition:** Any interference between the environment and the interactive system should be avoided, or at least kept to a minimum so that the user can maintain full control of the task under consideration.

**Consider:** Situational impairments such as lighting, noisy areas, limited physical space, etc. Design for low-light, noisy, or mobile contexts.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Allow interface magnification and font resizing in bright-light environments like labs or outdoors.
