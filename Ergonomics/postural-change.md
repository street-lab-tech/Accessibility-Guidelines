# Postural Change

**Definition:** The interface supports transitions between physical postures and usage conditions, facilitating performance and comfort, avoiding biomechanical stress and fatigue.

**Consider:**
* Various types of assistive technologies/input devices (e.g. keyboard, voice, switch devices, eye-tracking) that people with disabilities may use.
* Ensure that users can adjust viewing angles, interface layouts, and input methods to accommodate fatigue or different working positions.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Ensure that the UI can be personalized (e.g. resizeable) to accommodate different devices without losing familiarity and consistency in design.
