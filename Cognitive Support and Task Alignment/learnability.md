# Learnability

**Definition:** Users are able to discover, understand and retain how to use a system with minimal instructions. The system supports exploration of features, reduces memory burden, minimizes the learning curve, and provides support when learning is needed.

**Consider:**
* Users will likely discover through visual cues. People with visual disabilities need alternative formats (e.g. auditory) ways to discover. 
* Consider the needs of users with short-term memory impairments or limited prior exposure to similar systems.
* Elements that the user needs to discover include information, controls, system responses to action, navigation structure, data relationships, among others.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Include navigational aids to apply certain interactions that users will commonly use such as applying masks.
