# Freedom from distraction

**Definition:** The system presents information without other irrelevant information or competing stimuli interfering with its perception.

**Consider:** Need to be aware of not cognitively overwhelming users by addressing distractions across modalities (e,g. minimize competing visual effects, overlapping audio feedback, or haptic noise.)

## Examples
Example 1. Ensure that pop-ups with information don’t interrupt tasks; instead, provide display notifications that don’t block user interactions.
