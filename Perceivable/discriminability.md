# Discriminability

**Definition:** Presented information must be clearly distinguishable so users can tell different elements of information apart, especially in complex or data-dense contexts.

**Consider:** While the information should be presented noticeably differently, users should also have the ability to modify the UI so they can customize distinctions that suit their individual perceptual needs such as those with visual disabilities.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Use visual distinctions (e.g., shape, color, spacing) to differentiate overlapping elements such as channel markers or labels.
