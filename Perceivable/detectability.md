# Detectability

**Definition:** Information should be presented in a way that ensures users can notice its presence without difficulty, and recognize when a system action or state change has occurred.

**Consider:**
* Account for different modalities of perception.
* Important system states or actions (e.g., errors, confirmations) should trigger multiple sensory outputs (e.g., visual and auditory).

## Examples
_Example 1._ Provide audio feedback when a mask is applied or removed, in addition to visual confirmation.
