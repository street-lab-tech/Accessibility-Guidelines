# Environmental Responsiveness

**Definition:** The system adapts to environmental factors (e.g., lighting, sound levels, vibrations) that affect usability, comfort, and efficiency.

**Consider:** Provide user-adjustable modes (e.g., high contrast, dark mode, noise reduction) and design for robustness in variable settings. Avoid fixed designs that assume ideal environments

## Examples
_Example 1._ Provide a toggle for high-contrast visual modes to improve visibility in bright light conditions.
