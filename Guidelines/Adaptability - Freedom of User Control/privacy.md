# Sub-Guideline: Privacy

**Definition:** The system maintains the privacy of users using accessibility features at the same level as those not using these features.

**Consider:**
* Avoid revealing which users are using assistive technologies either through interface design, data handling, or backend systems.
* Design inclusive defaults to eliminate the need for separate versions.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Do not require users to login to access captions or narration features.
