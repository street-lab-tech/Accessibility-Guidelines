# Sub-Guideline: Error Resilience

**Definition:** The system should support error prevention, detection, and recovery, along with  minimizing negative consequences of user errors. Emphasize designing systems that are tolerant of mistakes and guide users toward successful interactions.

**Consider:**
* Assistive technologies should be able to detect and adjust accordingly to unpredictable, inconsistent and incorrect user inputs (e.g. correcting misheard spoken words, discounting rapid eye movement or unpredictable button sequence) to ensure more accurate interactions.
* Offer undo functionality. Support redundant confirmations for destructive actions.
* Validate inputs. Use clear, non-blaming error messages.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Providing suggestions (e.g. spelling, actions) when the system detects user errors.
