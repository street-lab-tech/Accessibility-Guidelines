# Sub-Guideline: Preservation of accessibility information during conversion

**Definition:** When information is converted from one format to another (e.g., exporting, saving, or rendering to alternative formats), the system must retain all accessibility-related metadata to the fullest extent possible, i.e. what the destination format supports.

**Consider:** Exported content should preserve alt-text, headings, language metadata, and table semantics. Ensure interoperability with AT-friendly formats.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Make sure that accessibility information such as alt-text is preserved when converted to a different file type.
