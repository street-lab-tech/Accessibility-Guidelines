# User Compatibility

**Definition:** The system accommodates a variety of anthropometric, biomechanical, and cognitive capabilities through compatible input/output configurations.

* Avoid requiring simultaneous use of multiple modalities.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Allow seamless switching from voice to keyboard input without reinitializing the task.
