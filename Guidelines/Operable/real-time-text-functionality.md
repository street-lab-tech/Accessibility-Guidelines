# Sub-Guideline: Real-Time Text (RTT) Functionality

**Definition:** Systems that provide two-way voice communication and real-time text to allow concurrent voice and text through a single user connection to complete their tasks.

**Consider:** Ensure that the system accommodates users who cannot rely on voice by supporting real-time text as a primary or supplementary communication modality.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Enable users to participate in synchronous interactions via both voice and RTT, allowing real-time communication through text input and auditory responses without requiring separate connections.

_Example 2._ Consider using [ARIA roles and attributes to support live updates](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA23).
