**Definition:** The system provides clear spatial and contextual cues to support navigability, especially in data-dense or spatial environments.

**Consider:** Spatial and contextual information can be conveyed through multiple modalities (e.g. visual, auditory). Validate navigation with various assistive technologies.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Ensure that the system offers a keyboard-navigable (screen reader friendly) interface of the data analysis image, including defining anchor points.

_Example 2._ Consider using [SVGs to create multiple interactive regions on a single image](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA23).
