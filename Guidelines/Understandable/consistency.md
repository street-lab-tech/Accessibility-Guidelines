# Sub-Guideline: Consistency

**Definition:** Interfaces should be consistent in their presentation and behaviours, helping users build reliable expectations about how the system works.

**Consider:**
* System interactions and element behaviours should be consistent by default (for e.g., re-use familiar UI paradigms across modules) so that this consistency is transferable to assistive technologies and input methods.
* Predictable interaction patterns support usability to those with diverse needs.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Ensure similar tasks use the same interaction method (e.g. selecting channels using dropdown rather than button).
