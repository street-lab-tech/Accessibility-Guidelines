# Sub-Guideline: Conciseness

**Definition:** The system presents information concisely, showing only what is necessary for the users’ immediate goals, avoiding irrelevant or redundant data that could increase cognitive burden.

**Consider:**
* Users will likely be presented with information visually. Support multimodal interpretation.
* Avoid presenting users with superfluous labels, excessive instructions, or data overload
* Use progressive disclosure where appropriate, especially for users with cognitive or perceptual limitations.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Ensure a UI section is not cluttered even when it includes similar interactions and information needed to complete tasks.
