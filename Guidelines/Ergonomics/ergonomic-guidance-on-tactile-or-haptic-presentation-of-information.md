# Sub-Guideline: Ergonomic guidance on tactile or haptic presentation of information

**Definition:** Tactile or haptic information is presented in a way that aligns with human haptic/active touch perception, capabilities, and comfort.

**Consider:**
* Use standardized patterns and intensities.
* Allow users to toggle or modulate haptic signals.
* Information should be conveyed in other modalities.

## Examples
_Example 1._ When using haptic feedback for errors, also display a visual message or auditory signals.
