# Sub-Guideline: Ergonomic guidance on visual presentation of information

**Definition:** Visual information is presented in a way that aligns with human visual perception, capabilities, and comfort.

**Consider:**
* Support scaling, spacing, and font legibility.
* Avoid dense text blocks or insufficient contrast.
* Provide layout alternatives.
* Information should be conveyed in other modalities.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Offer resizable UI with minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text elements.
