# Maintainability

**Definition:** The system should be designed to allow for easy maintenance and updates. This includes allowing for repairs, updates, bug fixes, and improvements without significant disruption to user workflows.

**Consider:** System maintenance and updates (e.g. changes to structure, labeling, or navigation) do not degrade usability for assistive technologies and input methods (e.g. keyboard, voice, switch devices, eye-tracking).

## Examples
_Example 1._ Ensure that users can still continue their work through system updates without losing their work.

_Example 2._ During a UI redesign, retain keyboard shortcuts and ARIA landmarks.
