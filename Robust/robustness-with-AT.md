# Robustness with AT

**Definition:** The system must be compatible with current assistive technologies and compatible or adaptable to future assistive technologies.

**Consider:**
* Understand when to use accessible HTML elements and when to supplement with ARIA.
* Test with various types of ATs to ensure that all interactions are plausible.

## Examples
_Example 1._ Ensure that you [use ARIA attributes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-accessibility-common-aria-mistakes-to-avoid/) that are defined by ARIA instead of creating new ones.
